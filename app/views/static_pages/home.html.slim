    h2 How do I get started?

    p The best way to get started is to show up to our meetings. We generally shoot for a split meeting format. The first hour we will present a topic to the members. The second hour is for them to explore that topic on their own laptop to gain experience.

    p Before you attend your first meeting, it is recommended you follow our <a href="#">Developer Setup Tutorial</a> so you can be productive as soon as you start.

    p You may also want to familiarize yourself with the <a href="http://ruby-lang.org">Ruby Programming Language</a> or look over our past meeting materials to familarize yourself with the topics you have missed.

    p If you do nothing else, <a href="https://lists.service.ohio-state.edu/mailman/listinfo/cwdg">Sign Up For The Mailing List</a> so we can let you know about all the sweet things.
